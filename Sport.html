<h1>Cricket</h1>
<h3><p>Cricket is an exciting outdoor game in India and is played in many countries worldwide.
<br> However, it is not so popular in the United States.
<br>Played is a fascinating game in many countries like India, England, and Australia. 
<br>It is a beautiful game played using a bat and a ball in the open space on the big field.Cricket is believed to have begun possibly
<br> as early as the 13th century as a game in which country boys bowled at a tree stump or at the hurdle gate into a sheep pen. This gate consisted 
<br>of two uprights and a crossbar resting on the slotted tops; the crossbar was called a bail and the entire gate a wicket. The fact that the bail could be dislodged 
<br>when the wicket was struck made this preferable to the stump, which name was later applied to the hurdle uprights. </p></h3>
